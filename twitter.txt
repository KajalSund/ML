hii! My name is Kajal Sund and i am requesting for Twitter API. I am doing machine learning training under Mr. Rahul Pathak at CETPA training center Noida, India. I will use this api to check working of machine learning algorithm in real time.



By using twitter data in real time one can analyze number of positive, negative and neutral tweets on a particular issue using machine learning algorithms.



It will take real time tweets, likes or comments and analyze and differentiate them on the basis of natural language used in tweets and intentions behind that particular tweet.


No, this application do not display Twitter content outside twitter directly, rather it only analyze data and predict results on Spyder API.


No, this is only a project to check machine learning algorithm working in real time big dataset.
